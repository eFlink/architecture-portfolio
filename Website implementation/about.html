                Hi there! My name is Denise Espinoza, and I am a 21-year-old architecture student with a passion for creating spaces that inspire and transform people's lives. Currently, I am studying for my Bachelor of Design (Architecture), and I am thrilled to share my portfolio with you.
                Architecture has been my passion for as long as I can remember, and I feel lucky to be pursuing my dreams at such a young age. I love designing buildings that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical and efficient, reflecting my understanding of architecture's role in shaping the built environment.
                My portfolio website showcases my journey so far, and I invite you to take a look at my work. I am always excited to take on new projects and collaborate with others, so please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions or opportunities you'd like to discuss.
            </p>
