architecture-portfolio

This repository contains the front-end code for my architecture student portfolio website created as part of the DECO1400 course at the University of Queensland. The website serves as a showcase of my architectural projects, skills, and design philosophy. It is built entirely using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience for visitors. Through this portfolio, I aim to highlight my creativity, attention to detail, and passion for architecture. Feel free to explore the code and design to gain insights into my work and the process behind building the website.
