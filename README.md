architecture-portfolio

This repository contains the front-end code for my architecture student portfolio website created as part of the DECO1400 course at the University of Queensland. The website serves as a showcase of my architectural projects, skills, and design philosophy. Built entirely using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website offers an interactive and visually appealing experience for visitors.

Additionally, I have included a comprehensive report that outlines the design process of the website, with a specific focus on user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). The report delves into the thoughtful considerations, usability principles, and design choices made to create an engaging and intuitive experience for users. It provides valuable insights into the methodology behind the website's design, enhancing the understanding of its visual aesthetics and functionality.

Feel free to explore the code, design, and report to gain a deeper understanding of my work, the development process, and the user-centered approach taken in designing the architecture portfolio website.
